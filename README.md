## Inspiration
A new research by Us Foods states that 79% of Americans have difficulty  choosing what to eat. Further it takes people on average about 12 minutes to answer the question: “What do you want for dinner?”. Thus, 3 meals per day is an app that helps people pick what people can eat based on what they read.

## What it does
When you search for something such as food that is good for health and read the article, the app will suggest three food based on what you read, if you click the name of the food, you can see the ingredients, the instructions, the tips & variations, as well as health benefits of the recipe of the meal. 

## How we built it
We built the Chrome Extension by using Chrome’s built-in AI models, such as Gemini Nano Prompt API, Javascript, Javascript. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to set up the models in Google Chrome and learn to make the extension work in Chrome.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build the Chrome Extension that works and suggest meals for people which ease their daily lives. 

## What we learned
We learnt about Chrome’s built-in AI models, such as Gemini Nano. We learnt to build app using Prompt API for Web and in Chrome Extensions. We also learnt to use Summarization API, Write API, and Rewrite API. 

## What's next for Three Meals per Day
We would like to improve the extension to suggest links to where buy the ingredients for the meals.
